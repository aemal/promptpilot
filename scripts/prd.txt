# Prompt Pilot - LinkedIn AI Comment Generator Chrome Extension - PRD

## Overview
Prompt Pilot is a Chrome extension that enhances LinkedIn user engagement by providing AI-powered comment suggestions. The extension adds a discrete AI button to each LinkedIn post, allowing users to generate contextually relevant comments with a single click. The generated comments are automatically copied to the clipboard and inserted into the LinkedIn comment box, streamlining the commenting process and improving user engagement quality.

**Problem Statement:** LinkedIn users often struggle to craft meaningful, engaging comments on posts, leading to generic responses or avoiding commenting altogether. This reduces engagement and networking opportunities.

**Solution:** An intelligent Chrome extension that analyzes LinkedIn post content and generates personalized, contextually appropriate comments using AI, making engagement effortless and more meaningful.

**Target Users:** LinkedIn professionals, content creators, sales professionals, and anyone looking to increase their LinkedIn engagement efficiently.

## Core Features

### 1. AI Button Injection
- **What it does:** Dynamically injects a styled AI button next to each LinkedIn post
- **Why it's important:** Provides easy access to AI comment generation without disrupting LinkedIn's native UI
- **How it works:** Content script monitors DOM changes, identifies post elements, and adds buttons with consistent styling

### 2. Post Content Extraction
- **What it does:** Extracts the complete text content from LinkedIn posts when the AI button is clicked
- **Why it's important:** Provides context for AI to generate relevant comments
- **How it works:** DOM parsing to identify and extract post text, handling various LinkedIn post formats (text, images, videos, polls)

### 3. AI Comment Generation
- **What it does:** Sends post content to external API and receives AI-generated comment suggestions
- **Why it's important:** Core functionality that provides value through intelligent comment creation
- **How it works:** HTTP POST request to specified webhook endpoint with post content, handles API responses and errors

### 4. Clipboard Integration
- **What it does:** Automatically copies generated comments to user's clipboard
- **Why it's important:** Allows users to paste comments elsewhere or have backup access
- **How it works:** Uses Chrome's clipboard API with proper permissions

### 5. Auto-insertion into Comment Box
- **What it does:** Automatically inserts generated comment into LinkedIn's comment input field
- **Why it's important:** Streamlines the commenting process, reducing friction
- **How it works:** DOM manipulation to find and populate comment textarea elements

### 6. Visual Feedback System
- **What it does:** Provides loading states, success/error indicators, and user feedback
- **Why it's important:** Keeps users informed about operation status and builds trust
- **How it works:** Dynamic button state changes, toast notifications, and visual cues
